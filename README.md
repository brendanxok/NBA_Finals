Analysis of team stats of every NBA Finals game from 1980 to 2017
Open the ipynb file and check out what I did.

So I was watching Inside the NBA one day and Charles Barkley was going off about how he doesn't like analytics in basketball, and how there's no way it can win you a championship. I didn't know what analytics was so I looked it up. However, I drew a different conclusion than Chuck did. It led me to wanting to do my own analysis and stuff like that, so here we are. It won't tell you how to win a game, but I mined some interesting facts and trends.

I focused on rebounds, assists, and shooting. Check out the notebook file to see it. It looks pretty and nice so enjoy.
